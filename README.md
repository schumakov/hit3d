# General

HIT3DP is a pseudospectral DNS code, that is, it performs direct numerical 
simulation of incompressible isotripic homogeneous turbulence with or without 
forcing.  The code has capability of carrying passive scalars, Lagrangian 
particles and Large Eddy Simulation


# Dependencies

The code is written in Fortran 90 and uses the two open libraries:

* Open-MPI  (www.open-mpi.org) - MPI implementation.  Does not have to be Open MPI, but recommended.
* FFTW3	    (www.fftw.org)
